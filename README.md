### Restaurant Website

Created my first website using html javascript css and bootstrap!
It's a website for a restaurant which is fully responsive for mobile and tablets as well.

Resources used:

The logo was made with [Logo.com](https://app.logo.com/).
The images were found on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
Help with the sitemap and sections [Relume](https://www.relume.io/)
Finally I used [Chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/) to help with copywriting
